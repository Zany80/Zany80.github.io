		<h2>Programming with Zany80</h2>
		<h3 style="color:red">Warning: this section is VERY incomplete!</h3>
		<p>
			There are actually two ways you can create working programs using 
			Zany80. What you <i>probably</i> want to do is to 
			<a href="javascript:load('/documentation/programming/games/', 'programming')">create a game</a>
			that can be played by the normal Zany80 configuration. You might
			also be interested in <a href="javascript:load('/documentation/programming/plugins/', 'programming')">writing a plugin</a>
			for Zany80.
