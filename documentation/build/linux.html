		<h2>Building for Linux</h2>
		<p><b>Warning: there are some things this guide assumes you know. If you
		encounter any trouble, please ask for help on the #zany80 channel on the
		<a href="https://discord.gg/BYbjDEP">Fantasy Consoles Discord server</a>
		(or, if you have IRC, the #zany80 channel on Freenode's network).</b></p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>Building Zany80 for Linux is extremely simple. The first thing to do is,
		of course, to download the source code. There are multiple places you
		can do this, but the easiest way by far is to use a tool called <code>git</code>.</p>
		<p>First, install <code>git</code> using your distro's package manager.
		On Debian-based systems (including Ubuntu) for instance, run
		<code>sudo apt install git</code>, and on Gentoo, run
		<code>sudo emerge -av dev-vcs/git</code>.</p>
		<p>Once <code>git</code> is installed, open a terminal in the folder you
		want to use to build Zany80, and clone the source code.</p>
		<p>These examples use /home/user/Builds/Zany80 for the build folder, but
		it doesn't matter where you do it.</p>
		<code class="shell_prompt">
			<span class=g>user@hostname</span>:<span class=b>~/Builds</span>$ git clone https://github.com/Zany80/Zany80<br>
			Cloning into 'Zany80'...<br>
			remote: Enumerating objects: 167, done.<br>
			remote: Counting objects: 100% (167/167), done.<br>
			remote: Compressing objects: 100% (105/105), done.<br>
			remote: Total 2194 (delta 74), reused 142 (delta 52), pack-reused 2027<br>
			Receiving objects: 100% (2194/2194), 12.98 MiB | 3.22 MiB/s, done.<br>
			Resolving deltas: 100% (1239/1239), done.<br>
			<span class=g>user@hostname</span>:<span class=b>~/Builds</span>$ cd Zany80<br>
			<span class=g>user@hostname</span>:<span class=b>~/Builds/Zany80</span>$ 
		</code>
		<p>Once you have the source code, the rest is extremely simple. The
build is handled by the build tool "fips", which is very lightweight and part of
the repository already.</p>
		<p>First, a configuration needs to be set. This can be done with</p>
		<code class="shell_prompt">./fips set config linux-ENVIRONMENT-TYPE</code>
		<p>For example, to create a release build using GNU Make, use the following:</p>
		<code class="shell_prompt">
			<span class=g>user@hostname</span>:<span class=b>~/Builds/Zany80</span>$ 
			./fips set config linux-make-release<br>
			'config' set to 'linux-make-release' in project 'Zany80'
		</code>
		<p>For a debug build, replace <code>release</code> with <code>debug</code>
		in the configuration name. For a full list of configurations, execute</p>
		<code class="shell_prompt">
			<span class=g>user@hostname</span>:<span class=b>~/Builds/Zany80</span>$ ./fips list configs
		</code>
		<p>There are a <i>lot</i> of configuration options, so you may want to
		pipe the output to <code>less</code> to make it more readable. It might
		also be useful to pipe the output to <code>grep linux</code> to hide the
		non-linux configurations.</p>
		<p>Once you have a configuration set, it's time to generate the build
		files.</p>
		<code class="shell_prompt">
			<span class=g>user@hostname</span>:<span class=b>~/Builds/Zany80</span>$ ./fips gen
		</code>
		<p>As this is the first build, it will first download some needed files.</p>
		<p>In the end, you should see something like this:</p>
		<code class="shell_prompt">-- Configuring done<br>
			-- Generating done<br>
			-- Build files have been written to: /home/user/Builds/Zany80/build/fips-build/Zany80/linux-make-release<br>
			1 configs generated
		</code>
		<p>If you're using an IDE (for instance, the linux-eclipse-release config),
		you should now be able to import the project, though further configuration 
		may be required. For Eclipse, I suggest modifying the build configuration
		of the Zany80-Release project to invoke 
		<code>bash -c "./fips build linux-eclipse-release"</code> instead of the
		default gmake. This is necessary so that Zany80's custom build command
		can move the plugins into a location that Zany80 can access them.</p>
		<p>Building can be done via <code>./fips build</code>, and you can run
		Zany80 via <code>./fips run zany80</code>.</p>
		<p>If you want to build a .tar.gz and a .deb package, you can run 
		<code>./fips make package</code>, and you should see (after some noise
		about the dependencies) something like this:</p>
		<code class="shell_prompt">
			[100%] Built target zany80<br>
			Run CPack packaging tool...<br>
			CPack: Create package using TGZ<br>
			CPack: Install projects<br>
			CPack: - Run preinstall target for: Zany80<br>
			CPack: - Install project: Zany80<br>
			CPack: Create package<br>
			CPack: - package: /home/user/Builds/Zany80/build/fips-build/Zany80/linux-make-release/Zany80-0.0.3.5-Linux.tar.gz generated.<br>
			CPack: Create package using DEB<br>

			1 configs built
		</code>
		<p>Note that these packages, unlike the official ones, are only good for
		systems that are similar to your own. <b>This is not a limitation I imposed</b>,
		but a technical one. The official builds are deliberately built by an old
		system, which limits the dependencies and makes it possible to run them
		on just about any modern system. The official builds are compiled with GCC
		4.8. If you build with GCC 7, however, your build will depend on a lot of
		cutting edge features which most setups don't have.</p>
		<p>If you want to create a package usable on most systems, either set up
		a chroot of an older system, or look into a solution like Docker.
		Alternatively, if you fork Zany80 on Github, you can modify the .travis.yml
		file and set up the free Travis CI system to create a portable build for
		you.</p>
		<p>As a final, somewhat tangential note: if you create a folder 
		<code>build/fips-deploy/emsc-make-release/</code> and run 
		<code>./fips run index emsc-make-release</code>, the contents of that
		folder will be served on an HTTP server on port 8000 (accessible at
		<code>localhost:8000</code>).</p>
