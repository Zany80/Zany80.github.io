		<p>Zany80 is a fantasy console designed around the 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Z80 processor</a>. Zany80
		programming is done in standard C, or directly in Z80 assembly. Check out the
		<a href="javascript:load('/documentation/programming/','content')">programming section</a>
		for more details.</p>
		
		<p>It's possible other CPUs such as the 6809 or AVR chips will be supported
		at some point as well.</p>

		<p>Zany80 has been open-source under the Apache 2.0 license since September 19th, 2017. The
		source is publicly accessible
		<a href="https://github.com/Zany80/Zany80">here</a>. Forks, pull requests, and
		bug reports are all welcome, and any and all assistance is hugely appreciated.
		</p>

		<p>Zany80 was originally called Zenith80, but the name was charged after
		the discovery that a company called Zenith Data Systems existed that
		worked with the Z80 processor so as to avoid confusion (and, admittedly, 
		while Zenith is a fun word, Zany80 just has a better ring to it).
